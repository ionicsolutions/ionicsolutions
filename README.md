### Hi there 👋

I'm Kilian, a software developer.

My journey into software engineering started in a physics research lab ⚛, where I discovered the merits of loose coupling and adherence to standards the hard way. (It's also the origin of my GitHub handle.)

I like automated testing, concise documentation, and hunting complex bugs. Over the years, I've worked on projects ranging from implementing FPGA-based ultra-fast measurement systems to architecting cloud applications. These days, I mostly code in Python 🐍 and spend much of my time on projects in the realm of cloud infrastructure and MLOps.
